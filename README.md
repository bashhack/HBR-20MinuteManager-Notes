## How to Use This Repository

- **Browse the transcriptions**: If you're interested in raw notes from each book, the `transcriptions/` folder contains my unprocessed thoughts and observations.

## Why Org-mode?

Emacs Org-mode is a powerful tool for organizing and structuring notes, and it allows for easy conversion of plain text into different formats (HTML, LaTeX, Markdown, etc.). These summaries can be exported into various formats depending on your needs.
