* Summary
Project management involves overseeing a project from start to finish. It is typically divided into four phases: planning, build-up, implementation, and closeout. Projects are distinct from processes, with a clear beginning, middle, and end, and often involve coordinating a team towards a specific goal. Project managers must possess strong organizational, financial, and interpersonal skills to effectively manage resources, schedules, and budgets across these phases. Each phase requires specific skills and tools, such as task analysis and scheduling charts, to ensure project success. 

* Notes

   - **Closeout**: Evaluate performance, document lessons, and prepare final reports.

** Key Skills and Tools for Each Phase
   - **Planning**: Task analysis, cost-benefit analysis, work breakdown structures.
   - **Build-Up**: Team building, delegation, scheduling tools like Gantt or PERT charts.
