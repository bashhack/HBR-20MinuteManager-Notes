** Effective Delegating
- Delegation should transfer responsibility for a task, project, or function to another person, but the delegator should retain control and responsibility over the larger work.
- The environment should encourage and support delegation.
- Delegation should also serve as a means to assess staff members' capabilities before promotions.

** Preparing to Delegate
- The delegator should determine what work to delegate, who to delegate to, and the level of authority to be granted.
- The delegator should also consider their reasons for delegating and identify the required skills for the task.

** Making the Assignment
- When delegating work, it is important to thoroughly describe the job and expectations to the person taking on the work.
- The delegator should also communicate the scope and authority of the assignment to other team members.

** Monitoring the Assignment
- After delegating, the delegator should regularly check the progress of the assignment, provide support, and anticipate and address problems.
- The delegator should avoid micromanaging and encourage independent problem-solving.

** Reviewing the Process
- After the assignment is completed, the delegator should evaluate what worked and what didn't, and use this information to improve future delegations.
- The delegator should also consider sharing the delegation skills they've learned with other team leaders.
