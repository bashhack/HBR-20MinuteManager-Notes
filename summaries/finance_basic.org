* Summary
Finance is crucial for all businesses as they need to generate and manage funds for operations. Understanding finance helps managers ask critical questions and make informed decisions regarding revenue sources, spending, and investment opportunities. The discipline involves navigating financial statements such as the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement, all of which provide insights into a company's profitability, financial position, and cash management. Accounting methods like GAAP dictate the presentation of these financials, using either cash-based or accrual accounting. Accrual accounting, which matches costs to associated revenues, is more prevalent due to its accuracy in depicting profits. The income statement reveals a company's net income over a period by detailing revenues and subtracting expenses. The balance sheet provides a snapshot of financial health, listing assets, liabilities, and owner's equity, while the cash flow statement illustrates cash generation and usage. Financial health is assessed through ratio analysis, examining profitability, efficiency, liquidity, and leverage. This analysis helps in evaluating investment opportunities through methods like ROI, payback period, and NPV. Budgets align with strategic goals and can be prepared using top-down or bottom-up approaches. Quantifying assumptions and calculating ROI are vital in decision-making, ensuring investments align with company objectives. Performance tracking and variance analysis enable adjustments to maintain financial health.
